# laud Changelog

## Development

### Added

- Initial project scaffolding: workspace, quality gate, and documents.
- `laud import` adds audio and video files, or whole directories, to a local
  library, skipping anything already stored.
- `laud transcribe` turns recordings into timestamped, language-detected
  transcripts with whisper.cpp.
- `laud ls` and `laud show` list the library and print a transcript as text,
  JSON, SRT, or VTT.
- `laud doctor` reports every missing tool, model, and permission, with how
  to fix each one.
- Runtime dependencies are pinned to exact versions, so an install never
  drifts to an untested release.
- Config lives at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/laud/config.yaml`, with two keys:
  `stt.whisperCpp.binary` and `stt.whisperCpp.model`.
- Every command exits with one of four codes: 0 ok, 1 failure, 2 usage, 3
  environment -- a scriptable, stable contract.
- `laud transcribe --multilingual` detects and preserves each language in a
  code-switched recording instead of tagging the whole thing with one.
- `laud setup` provisions a fresh machine -- ffmpeg, whisper.cpp, and a
  transcription model -- asking once for consent (`--yes` to skip it, e.g.
  in CI) and letting `--model` pick which model to download.
- `laud doctor --fix` runs the same provisioning engine as `setup`, scoped
  to only the checks that are currently failing, then re-checks.
